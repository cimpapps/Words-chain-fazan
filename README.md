**Task: Word Chain**

Word chains are a  game often that is found in the games section of newspapers. The target of the game is to get the next word from the first one by changing the last 2 letters of the word each time and starting the next word with them. Each change of the letters must result in a legal intermediate word. 

EXAMPLE: We can change FACULTATE into RELEU through the following steps:

	FACULTATE → TENERIFE → FERICIRE → RELEU
